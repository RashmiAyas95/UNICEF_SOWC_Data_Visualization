For our Analysis we selected five countries on the basis of Population and Annual number births in 2018.
4 Countries are from Asia namely China, India, Indonesia and Pakistan.
We analyzed this countries with developed nation and most powerful nation: United States.

Each year, in The State of the World’s Children (SOWC), UNICEF reports a series of mortality estimates for children. 
UN IGME mortality estimates are updated annually through a detailed review of all newly available data points, which often results in adjustments to previously reported estimates.
As a result, consecutive editions of The State of the World’s Children should not be used for analyzing mortality trends over time. 

Thus, to conclude:
Developing nations like India, Indonesia and Pakistan 
have higher Infant Mortality and Neonatal Deaths than developed nations like United States and China.
With proper immunization coverage, the Life Expectancy at birth has exponentially 
increased from 1970 to 2018 in developing and developed nations.
Due to regional beliefs, literacy ratio of female is still a major concern in countries like India and Pakistan.
